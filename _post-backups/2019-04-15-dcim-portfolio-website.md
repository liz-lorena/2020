excerpt: This is my DCIM minor capstone portfolio website adapted from a previous portfolio website into a one-page website. For this project I learned to use jQuery to create a filter for my projects based on the skills I used. I consider this porfolio website to be more of a "spin-off" than a "mainline" iteration.
