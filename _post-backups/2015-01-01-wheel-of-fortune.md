excerpt: This is my second completed game made with MIT's Scratch game design tool for my intro to computer science class final project my senior year of high school. Although the programming language is rudimentary, the loops in this game are much more complex than in my previous one. This game is an adaptation of the Wheel of Fortune tv game show with some subtle world-building behind the game.

<p>This was the second complete game I made. This was basically an adaptation of the Wheel of Fortune game using the Scratch tool by MIT for my Computer Science clas my senior year of high school. Although the tool is generally used by younger children as an introduction to programming, I still learned a great deal from using this tool even though I had initially learned about programming with Visual Basic code. Coding in this program is done through "logic blocks" that are fit together like a puzzle and altered. I ended up with multiple pages worth of these code blocks by the time I finished this project, and it played surprisingly well.</p>

<h3>The Take Away</h3>

<p>This project showed me I could work well with different kinds of tools and push them to their limits. I tried to use as much of the program's functionalities to make a game with a complex underlying code. I highly recommend challenging yourself or others, no matter their programming skill level, to remake a complex game using this simple tool. You will be pleasantly surprised with the outcome.</p>
