excerpt: My second portfolio was an original multi-page design made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I had fun trying to add creative flairs to this one. When the website loads, you must click an arrow to reveal my portfolio items and a minimalist white theme. I also made a handmade image toggler of example commissions. I might go back and implement Jekyll on this one to be more space-saving.
