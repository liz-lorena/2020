excerpt: This is a web application I made with four teammates. With this website you can find jobs and companies in your area and also get directions to them. It uses four APIs, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, and PHP and was developed using Amazon's Cloud 9. My responsibilities included the Google Maps Embed API, the Github Jobs API, styling, and debugging. Note that the Google Autocomplete API may not work on the current host of this website.
