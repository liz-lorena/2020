excerpt: This final group project was made with two teammates for my first university Web Design course my sophomore year. The goal was to recreate three page of the Metropolitan Museum's portal on Archive.org and redesign the landing page. This was the first time I hard-coded a page since my senior high school web design class, and using CodePen.io I discovered I really enjoyed using HTML and CSS.
