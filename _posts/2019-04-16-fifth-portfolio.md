excerpt: My fifth portfolio is an original design made with HTML and CSS. The portfolio section is in a grid of four columns. Each project photo has a short summary below it. There are also multiple pages that can be accessed through a standard navigation bar. It was an attempt at minimalism with function over form, but it eventually looked too cluttered for my taste.
