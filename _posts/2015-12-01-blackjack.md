excerpt: This was my final project for my first computer science course in university. It's my third completed game and my first game made in the Java programming language. It's simply BlackJack but in a text-based form. I was proud of this project at the time, but it could definitely be rewritten. Either way I saved this as an important milestone in my programming journey.
