excerpt: This is a fake database I was creating using HTML, CSS, and the Jekyll static site generator. This website serves as a record of all video games where animals are the focus and contains all sorts of information on them including their title, release date, publishers, developers, and more. In August 2020, I decided I would narrow the focus to only Japanese kemono.
