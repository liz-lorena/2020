<p>This was my partnered midterm project for my game design class in my junior year of college. It was the first time I ever made anything with Unity, and it was a lot of fun to learn how to use this software and how to make a 2D side-scroller. Unfortunately, it was also quite stressful to make this game because of the glitches in Unity's cloud collaboration feature. Also I found that I don't like the click-and-drag nature of this software because it makes everything feel super imprecise.</p>

<p>It would be cool if you gave this game a play, but I'm not lying in the Itch.io description that this is the worst thing I've ever made. In the game, you're a space soldier escaping your ship which has become infested with hell-spawn. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Sound familiar?</em></a> The game ends when you fly to Earth. I made the third level by myself, and it differs from the rest of the game because there you fly a ship and shoot asteroids.</p>

<h4>The Take Away</h4>

<p>I hate Unity for 2D games. And I hate working on the same project as someone else at the same time because source control is just really crap in teams. But I learned this earlier in the text adventure game that was repo'd on Github, which is why I came into this project with some dread from the beginning. From this experience, I realized I wanted to go back and learn to use GameMaker Studio for my midterm project in my leadership in digital contexts class. One plus was that I learned some C#, which was on my list of programming languages to learn.</p>
