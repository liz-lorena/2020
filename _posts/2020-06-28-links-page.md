excerpt: This page used to only be a simple replacement for the linktr.ee service. It was a short bio with a list of my most important profile and website links, but in 2020 I realized it could be my new portfolio website because there was plenty of room for experimentation with my current level of coding. It now also has a gallery of my favorite projects, a longer about page, and my resume. My favorite addition to this version of my portfolio is that you can flip over each card to reveal more information about the project on the back.
