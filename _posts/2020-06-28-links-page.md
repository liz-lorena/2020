excerpt: In 2018 this page used to only be a simple replacement for the linktr.ee service as a page of my most important website links, but in 2020 I realized it could be a good minimalist portfolio website. My favorite addition to this version of my portfolio is that you can flip over each project card to reveal more information on the back.
