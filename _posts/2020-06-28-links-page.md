excerpt: This page used to only be a simple replacement for the linktr.ee service. It's list of my most important website links, but in 2020 I realized it could be my new minimalist portfolio website with my current level of coding. It now also has a gallery of my favorite projects. My favorite addition to this version of my portfolio is that you can flip over each card to reveal more information about the project on the back.
