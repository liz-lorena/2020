excerpt: My third portfolio was an original multi-page design made with HTML and CSS and was the first of my portfolio sites to use the Jekyll static site generator. The layout is two panels, one with a fixed featured image, and the other with scrolling content. The navigation is in a Z shape. The idea behind this design is that the website is a "home" with things on the inside and a "window" to the outside.
