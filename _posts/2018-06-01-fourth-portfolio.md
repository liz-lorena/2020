excerpt: My fourth portfolio is an original design made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, some Javascript, and Jekyll. This website was designed to be a dark theme and with responsiveness in mind. My projects are lists in a single column and text is minimal. This is also when I started having fun with tooltip styling and bright colors.

<p>And finally, this is my current portfolio, and it's the design I've been happiest with by far. For this one, I wanted to go as simple as possible and once again used my graphics to preview my projects, a dropdown button for the mobile navigation, and Jekyll. I also learned how to make custom tooltips and a cute <a href="https://codepen.io/P1N2O/pen/pyBNzX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSS gradient animation</a> for the special link to my blog. Instead of using a white theme, I went for a kickass dark theme because I find it to be much easier on the eyes. Here is also where I changed my logo colors from blue and gold to blue-violet and turquoise.</p>
