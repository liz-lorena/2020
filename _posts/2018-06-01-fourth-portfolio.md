excerpt: My fourth portfolio is an original design made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, some Javascript, and Jekyll. This website was designed to be a dark theme and with responsiveness in mind. My projects are lists in a single column and text is minimal. This is also when I started having fun with tooltip styling and bright colors.
