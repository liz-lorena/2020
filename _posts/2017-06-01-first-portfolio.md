<p>I think this is the earliest screenshot I have from my early attempts at making a website with a proper design from scratch. I tried to go with a minimalist modern design with lots of white space again, but I wasn't happy with the loose and sloppy way the pages behaved. In retrospect, the index page does look pretty cool, and if I only still had the source code I would share it with you over on my Github. In fact, I may try to remake it sometime. I do recall that I used bootstrap to center the elements on the page and make the buttons, so this places this design somewhere in mid to late 2017.</p>

<p>My first stable portfolio site was made thanks to the work of <a href="http://taniarascia.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tania Rascia</a>, a web developer who makes extremely useful tutorials for web development and design. This particular theme was made available by her for free on Github <a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. She has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/taniarascia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Patreon</a>, so you can support her there!</p>

<p>This theme is a trendy one page theme that looks fabulous on mobile with its sliding menu. Because at this point I was learning about the importance of responsiveness in modern web design, I took apart and reassembled this code with some modifications to learn further. Its simplicity makes it best for a resume-style personal website.</p>

<p>With this theme I got to experiment with a little bit of Javascript and jQuery, making my project descriptions toggle on and off. I actually started making tons of progress GIFs at this point with <a href="https://www.screentogif.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ScreenToGif</a>, and it's thanks to that that I'm able to recover bits of my progress to make this blog!</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the whole site using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/" target="_blank">FireShot FireFox extension</a>:</p>
