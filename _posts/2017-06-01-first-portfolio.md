excerpt: My first portfolio was a one-page design made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. I repurposed a design by Tania Rascia that was freely available for use as a template on her Github. I used some simple jQuery for the projects portion of the website. This was the first stepping stone to making my own complete personal website from scratch.
