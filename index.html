<p>Welcome! This is the website of Liz Lorena Berberena, a female gamer, hobby artist, and professional front-end web developer based in New Jersey. I have been coding since 2013 and graduated May 2019 from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Information Technology and Informatics, and I currently work full-time as a Web Producer for The Lynx Group. Below I've highlighted a few of my best projects, but you can see all of them <a href="/projects">here</a>. You can also read <a href="/cv">my CV</a>, <a href="/about">my long bio</a>, and <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my résumé</a>. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:<email></email>"><email></email></a>.</p>
