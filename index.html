<p>Welcome! This is the website of Liz Lorena Berberena, a female gamer, hobby artist, and professional front-end web developer based in New Jersey. I've been coding since 2013 and graduated May 2019 from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Information Technology and Informatics. I currently work full-time as a Web Producer for The Lynx Group. Below I've highlighted a few of my best projects, but you can see all of them on the projects page.</p>
