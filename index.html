<p>Welcome! This is the website of <strong>Liz Lorena Berberena</strong>, a female gamer, hobby artist, and professional front-end web developer based in New Jersey. Online I'm also known as <strong>CozyMaus</strong> (sometimes stylized as cozymaus). I've been coding since 2013 and graduated May 2019 from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Information Technology and Informatics. I currently work full-time as a Web Producer for The Lynx Group. Below I've highlighted my relevant online platforms and my current favorite personal projects.</p>
