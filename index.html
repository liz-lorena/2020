<p>Welcome to my coding portfolio! I am a female gamer and artist whose specialty is <strong>front-end web development</strong>. I have been coding since 2013 and graduated in May 2019 from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Information Technology and Informatics. I currently work as a Web Producer full-time. Here you can view a complete list of my most complete projects and connect with me on my favorite online platforms listed below. You can also <a href="/about">read more about me</a>.
