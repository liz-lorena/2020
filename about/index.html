    Thank you for wanting to know more about me. To go back to the short bio <a href="/">click here</a>.

    My name is Liz, but my boyfriend calls me Lizzy. I'm a 22-year-old female front-end web developer from cuba living in new jersey, usa who spends way too much time on the internet. i love making and fixing websites - static ones especially - and know some programming languages and game design thanks to school. i am also a hobby digital artist and writer with aspirations of running a store and telling a story through a digital medium like video games. i speak, read, and write both spanish and english fluently and used to study french and german.
    <br><br>
    
    to relax i watch anime, play video games, eat sweets, go jogging, listen to music, snuggle my plushies, and just chill at home with my family, my parrotlets, and my love, andrew. my interests change a lot, but some specific things i am currently obsessed with are pastel-colored or black clothing, spinel, <em>animal crossing</em>, <em>hunter x hunter</em>, <em>neon genesis evangelion</em>, animals, clowns, and plushies.
    <br><br>
    
    if i could be successful at anything related to my current skillset my dream job would be either doing freelance as a web developer, running an online handmade toy and clothing store, or creating my own works of fiction. my boyfriend and i <strong>MIGHT</strong> work on video games independently someday. for now, maintaining company websites as a salaried employee is my favorite way to earn a stable income.
    <br><br>
    
    so far i am pretty happy with how my life has turned out. all that's left is to have a nice little house for my family and be with andrew for the rest of my life.
