   <h2>About Me</h2>
</div>
<p>Thank you for wanting to know more about me. I last updated this website on {{ site.time | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}.</p>
<p>I'm a front-end web developer who's been living in the United States since the age of 3. I have a wide variety of interests, but most are in the digital sphere. I love making and fixing websites and have been coding since the age of 16. I am fluent in Spanish and English and studied French in high school and university. On my own time during middle school I mainly studied German.</p>
<p>In May of 2019 I graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in information technology and informatics (ITI). I minored in digital communication, information, and media (DCIM) and earned a certificate of game production and innovation. In July, 2019, I got my first full-time job as a Junior Web Producer and was promoted to Web Producer in March of the following year.</p>
<p>Currently my favorite activities outside of my main passion of web development are watching anime and movies, playing video games, drawing, creative writing, listening to music and youtube videos, and learning about psychology, true crime, and internet subcultures.</p>
<p>I love my parents, my parrotlets, and my fianc√©!</p>
