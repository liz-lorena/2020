    <p>Thank you for wanting to know more about me. To go back to the short bio <a href="/">click here</a>.</p>
	
    <p>My name is Liz. I'm a 22-year-old female front-end web developer who was born in Cuba and has been living in New Jersey, USA since the age of 3. I love making and fixing websites - static ones especially - and know some programming languages and game design thanks to school. I am also a hobby digital artist and writer with aspirations of telling a story through a digital medium like video games. I speak, read, and write both Spanish and English fluently and used to study French and German.</p>

<p>In May of 2019 I graduated magna cum laude from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ with a Bachelor of Arts degree in information technology and informatics. I minored in digital communication, information, and media and earned a certificate of game production and innovation. In July 2019 I got my first full-time job as a Junior Web Producer and was promoted to Web Producer in March of the following year.</p>
    
    <p>Things that made me happy include watching anime, playing video games, listening to videos or livestreams, being with my close family and parrotlets, and hanging out with the love of my life, Andrew.</p>
    
    <!--<p>if i could be successful at anything related to my current skillset my dream job would be either doing freelance as a web developer, running an online handmade toy and clothing store, or creating my own works of fiction. my boyfriend and i <strong>MIGHT</strong> work on video games independently someday. for now, maintaining company websites as a salaried employee is my favorite way to earn a stable income.</p>-->
    
    <p>so far i am pretty happy with how my life has turned out. all that's left is to have a nice little house for my family and be with andrew for the rest of my life.</p>
